# Carbon Coal Control (Project C3)

## Project Overview
The **Coal Carbon Control (C3)** project is a web-based application designed to manage and reduce carbon emissions in coal mines. It helps mining operations track emissions, explore carbon neutrality pathways, visualize trends, and optimize resource utilization to align with sustainability goals. The system is modular, allowing scalability and adaptability to future environmental needs.

## Key Features
1. **Emission Estimation Module**: Collects and calculates carbon emissions based on user input, including fuel usage, machinery hours, and transport distance.
2. **Pathways Simulation Module**: Recommends carbon neutrality pathways such as afforestation or renewable energy adoption based on emission data.
3. **Visualization Module**: Graphically represents emission data trends and comparisons through interactive charts and graphs.
4. **Resource Management Module**: Tracks energy consumption, carbon sinks, and forest management to optimize sustainability practices.
5. **Admin Module**: Allows administrators to manage data, view records, and generate CSV reports for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Predictive Analytics**: Integration of machine learning to forecast future emissions and provide proactive planning.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: IoT integration for live data collection from mining equipment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js for data visualization)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js for RESTful APIs)
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend
